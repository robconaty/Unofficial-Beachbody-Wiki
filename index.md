## Welcome
Welcome to my wiki, where I'll be posting reviews of workout programmes by Beachbody. There's a lot of review sites out there, but many of them are short on information and long on before/after photos and ads. If you prefer a 'just the facts ma'am'
approach then this site is for you. In addition to balanced reviews I aim to source useful content such as workout planners, sample programmes and hybrid workout suggestions, where you mix the best parts of different workout programmes from Beachbody on Demand to powerful effect.

## Who is this guy anyway?

I'm Jayk, an independent Team Beachbody coach in the UK. Does that mean my reviews are biased? Not at all. Beachbody has hundreds of programmes and I will only be reviewing the ones I have tried or believe to be high quality. If I don't think it's worth your time, I won't review it. Simple as that.

I've never come across a perfect workout programme, so all of my reviews cover the cons as well as the pros, helping you to reach your own decision.

## Need a coach or want to partner with me?

As an independent Team Beachbody coach I am happy to be your personal ass kicker, and to keep you accountable on your journey towards your fitness and wellbeing goals.

Or if you're interested in earning some extra income by becoming a Team Beachbody coach yourself, I'd love to work with you.

Drop me an email by clicking the 'Feedback' button in the top navigation bar if you need a coach or want to be a coach. I'm especially interested in hearing from people who like the kinds of Beachbody programmes which I am simply not going to do. Personally I tend to focus on resistance training and if it's cardio it has to be HIIT or outdoor (cycling, running, football i.e. soccer). Examples of workouts that I love include P90x, Insanity Max 30, Body Beast, LIIFT4 etc.  

All I'm saying is I'm unlikely to do Country Heat, Brazilian Butt Lift or Let's Get Up! even though they may serve their purpose well.

I have to be honest and say that I probably subconsciously choose workouts that seem to be aimed more at men, although I try not to let marketing influence me. That may explain why I haven't done many workouts by Autumn Calabrese or Megan Davies, even though I know they are among the best.

That's why I'm especially interested in partnering with someone who has completely different tastes than I do. If that's you then get in touch.

## Rome wasn't built in a day

I'll admit the content is a little sparse right now. It takes time to write these reviews but I'm working as fast as I can to write new ones and to add them to the site. It was important for me to get this site up in skeleton form, because I felt that if I were to wait until I've reviewed all the programmes I want to cover this site would never happen. If you'd like to be involved in writing reviews with me, drop me an email by clicking the 'Feedback' button in the top navigation bar.

## Read my reviews

Right now I'm doing 30 Day Breakaway, an outdoor or treadmill running programme with made up of short 20-25 minute runs as well as resistance workouts. I will add more reviews soon.
