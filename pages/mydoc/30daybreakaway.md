summary: 30 Day Breakaway is billed as a hybrid running and resistance training programme to prepare you to complete a 5k run. It includes both strength/weight training workouts and runs of 20-25 minutes across a training calendar designed to get you ready for race day. You can choose to run either outdoor by downloading guided audio training on your phone or indoor on a treadmill, in which case you can follow the trainer Idalis Velazquez on her runs through amazing natural settings.

## What I liked about the programme

I found 30 Day Breakaway to have a lot more depth to it than some of the other running programmes focused on 5k. The incorporation of training ‘ladders’, involving short periods of fast running or sprinting interspersed with light jogging, do add a HIIT (high intensity interval training) element and also mean that you can dial up or down the level of intensity to match your ability and experience. There is also a resistance element involving dumbbells and bands to add more of a challenge. In addition, the programme has a choice of training calendars, from advanced to beginner and a ‘time crunch’ challenge for those who want to finish every workout within half an hour.

A lot of thought clearly went into creating a programme that inspires the passion for running that drives so many millions of people to take up the sport. For obvious reasons there’s no video included for the outdoor running element, so you will have to make do with audio recordings. However, the trainer has an infectious energy to compensate, throwing in Spanish words and phrases every now and then when the intensity picks up.

Those of us in rainy climates, like the UK, might appreciate the rainy-day cardio session (although the indoor cardio and resistance workouts are not the best, as I will explain). And if you do have a treadmill, you’ll like the video guided runs, which are shot in incredibly beautiful locations including pristine beaches, mountain trails and lush forests (I guess it’s all shot in southern California?).

As someone who has done some running over the years without ever properly focusing on my form or experimented with intervals, I did find the guided aspects of the training to be helpful and motivating. I really liked the tips to remind me to lift my knees, raise my head, relax my shoulders etc. which helped me to maintain the correct form throughout my training. If you’ve been part of a running club or consider yourself to be an advanced runner, you probably won’t get much value out of it.

I liked the use of RPE (Rate of Perceived) as a system to guide me when to push and when to slow down. Basically, the trainer lets you know where you should be on the RPE scale (see table) at different stages of the run, so you can adjust your pace to fit.


| **RPE Scale** | **RPE Rating** | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 10 | **Max effort** | You should only be able maintain this for a very short time. You will feel very out of breath and unable to have a conversation. |
| 9 | **Very hard** | You will find it hard to maintain this level of intensity for a long time. You will only be able to speak a few words. |
| 7-8 | **Vigorous** | This is getting uncomfortable. You will feel some shortness of breath but will be able to speak a sentence. |
| 4-6 | **Moderate** | You will be breathing heavily but able to hold a conversation. |
| 2-3 | **Light** | You feel like you can maintain this pace for hours. It&#39;s easy to hold a conversation. |
| 1 | **Very light** | Hardly any exertion, but more than sleeping or watching TV. You might be taking a gentle stroll, for example.

As a side note, I like that the programme includes a Spanish language option. Having studied Spanish this provided me with a nice refresher and obviously if you are a Spanish speaker you’ll appreciate this.

Right now, I’m prioritising strength training so the short guided are perfect for me, providing enough cardio to keep my weight in check without affecting my strength gains too much. If my focus was cardio endurance, I would choose a slightly longer or at least more intensive format, unless it’s been a very tough day at work, in which case this might be just fine.



## What I liked less about the programme

Well, I don’t own a treadmill for a start, which is not a problem in the sense that the programme can be adapted for either outdoor or indoor runs. The thing is, most of the production value has gone into filming outdoor runs in beautiful settings, so, if I had purchased my Beachbody on Demand subscription especially for this product, I might feel a bit short changed.

Overall, my primary training focus is strength training, and I found this aspect of the programme to be very lacking. The strength workouts are very basic and not at the level of other intermediate strength training workouts available through BOD such as the excellent LIIFT4 programme or Body Beast. In my personal experience, weight training only works effectively if it is sufficiently intensive and focused on progressive overload (increasing the amount of weight during each session). For this reason, I think the training benefits of the resistance aspects of this programme are likely to be limited or negligible for a lot of people. I would much rather have seen more emphasis on yoga or stretching and running, which I think would have provided more benefits to most runners within the limitations of this format. The resistance exercises weren’t exactly terrible but there are clearly much better alternatives on BOD (LIIFT 4, P90/P90x, Body Beast, The Work etc.).

## What equipment do I need?
Pair of running shoes (duh). Some dumbbells and resistance loops (to increase intensity). If you really want to go the whole way, then you need a foam roller, or something shaped like one.

## What's included?
The following table, taken from the training product guide for this programme, lists all of the resources included and explains their benefits. Excuse the cheesy marketing copy, courtesy of Beachbody. Hopefully it gives you an idea about what to expect.

## About the trainer, Idalis Velazquez
Idalis Velazquez is very relatable, motivating and she has great energy  I found a lot of the tips useful too. If you speak Spanish or want to learn you’ll love that the workouts come in a choice of English or Spanish. Her advice is nothing really new (don’t let your arms cross the centre line, head in neutral position, lift your knees, land mid-foot etc.) but the guided element did make this helpful. Personally, I find that my form tends to slip when my mind wanders so having specific reminders to keep my posture in check has helped me improve my running.

## Who is it for?
The simple answer is that this is for people who want to run their first 5k, while burning some fat. However, one thing I’m sure will confuse a lot of people is that the programme is listed as ‘intermediate’ in the Beachbody on Demand library. If you are somebody who has already been running for some time you may consider 5k to be a challenge for novices. In fact, many other programmes out there on the market such as ‘Couch to 5k’ are clearly pitching themselves to people who have never run or are out of shape. Not too long ago, I ran a 5k with my 9-year-old son and he, like many of the kids who took part, didn’t find it extremely challenging. I crashed out, but that’s another story.

Seriously though, just as with any distance running discipline, the difficulty level is really down to you. A fast 5k, like a fast mile, is extremely challenging and by aiming for personal bests and setting yourself distance targets in the running workouts it’s certainly possible to make this as difficult as you want it to be…at least in theory.

In practice, I did find the programme to be less intensive than other intermediate Beachbody programmes including Focus T25 for cardio workouts and Body Beast for resistance training. As a cardio exercise, the running part felt less challenging than a typical HIIT session, because there was no trainer to keep pace with. There was no pressure comparable with having to match Shaun T’s burpees rep for rep. That’s not necessarily a bad thing. If you’re looking for a less pressured workout then this could be for you. If you want to collapse in a puddle of sweat at the end of every session, then go for Insanity Max 30 instead.

## The verdict
I would suggest to consider this programme if the following applies to you:

* You’re a beginner to running or are returning to running after a long break.
* You are looking for a simple way to shed some fat and get outdoors or make use of your treadmill.
* You are an intermediate runner who wants to focus on improving your form (I found the form checks to be quite helpful as I tend to forget to maintain proper form while I’m running). If this is you I would probably do one of the runs once or twice max.
* You want to add a cardio element to a strength training programme (if for example you are doing Body Beast it may make sense to swap out the cardio workout included in the programme with the recorded runs for added variety). If this is you, I think you can safely skip the resistance aspects of this programme, which you won’t find challenging enough.

If you belong to one of the last two groups the programme is only worth considering if you already have a Beachbody on Demand subscription since you will probably only dip in and of one or two workouts from 30 Day Breakaway.

I think this could be the start of an excellent new franchise and hope that Beachbody releases a 10k or a half marathon version in the future.
