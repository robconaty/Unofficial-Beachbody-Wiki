## What I liked about the programme

Body Beast certainly stands out in the home workout pantheon because I can't think of a single comparable alternative to it, either among the offerings from Beachbody on Demand or its competitors.The closest comparison might be the small number of home workout options on the bodybuilding.com app, but I don't think any of them provide such a comprehensive programme that is so varied as this one. It very cleverly balances the needs of users who have only very minimal equipment (e.g. resistance bands and a balance ball), as well as intermediate lifters (who might have a few dumbbells, pull-up bar, an EZ curl bar and a bench). It is theoretically sound, grounded in the principles of progressive overload. This means you are encouraged to take notes at the end of every set and to try to increase the weight each session in order to get stronger. This design ensures that, with perseverance, you will see results over time. Body Beast covers all major muscle groups and places the emphasis on compound lifts including bench press, shoulder press, deadlift, rows, while also making room for isolation exercises for added definition where it counts (bicep curls, tricep kick-backs, flys etc.).

As someone who is focused on resistance workouts, I have returned to Body Beast more than to any other Beachbody programme. In fact, while I am now working out independently, the programme I follow is adapted from Body Beast.

Conveniently, Body Beast gives you two training calendar options, namely 'Lean Beast' and 'Huge Beast'. Essentially, if you just want to get as big as possible and are less concerned about fat it's time to go huge. If you want to integrate a little more cardio and to focus on shedding that spare tyre, the lean option is the better bet. At the end of the programme, if you have Beachbody on Demand, you can also progress on to some the more advanced 'Beast Up' workouts, which are longer and great for those who are up for a challenge.

Body Beast is designed around dynamic set training. There's some debate about whether dynamic set training is necessary for beginner or intermediate lifters, and programmes like this have come under some criticism since dynamic sets are generally aimed at those who are already advanced and need to shake-up their training in order to break through a plateau. Regardless of this debate, having a mixture of sets did keep things interesting in my opinion and certainly won't harm your results, even if they might not live up to the Beast's hype.

So what does dynamic set training entail. Here are a few examples (text by Beachbody).

| **A Super Set       | 2 exercise movements done back-to-back without rest.**                                                                                                                        |
| **A Giant Set       | 3 exercise movements, done back-to-back, that all target the same muscle group.**                                                                                               |
| **A Multi-Set       | 3 exercises that don’t target similar muscle groups.**                                                                                                                          |
| **A Force Set       | 5 sets of 5 reps, with 10 seconds of rest between each set.   **                                                                                                                |
| **A Progressive Set** | A pyramid that goes from high reps to low reps, takes a break, then back up to high reps. For example: 15 reps, 12 reps, 8 reps—90-second rest—then 8 reps, 12 reps, 15 reps. |
| **A Combo Set   **    | Contains a compound exercise, which is any exercise that works more than one muscle group using more than one joint.                                                          |
| **A Circuit Set **   | Involves moving from 1 exercise to another without rest.                                                                                                                      |
| **A Tempo Set**       | Holds a contraction for a given amount of time. For example, 6 seconds during the concentric action and 6 seconds during the eccentric action.                                |

## What I liked less about the programme

Expect to do a lot of reps with this programme. Everyone dreads leg day don't they? Well, with Body Beast I did find some of the leg workouts to be especially monotonous and long. For example, on the Bulk Legs workout, 'front to back lunges' involve three sets (12, 10, 8 reps) per leg. That doesn't sound much, but it is a lot when you consider that each lunge, (front to back) is effectively 2 reps, so the actual number of reps per leg is more like 24, 20, 16. The high number of reps and relatively low weight mean that, for legs at least, Body Beast is not an especially efficient workout and is incredibly boring after a spell. You would probably be better off getting into your local gym on leg day if at all possible, where you can take advantage of the leg press and squat rack to really lift heavy and get more done in a shorter space of time (i.e. fewer reps, heavier weight, focusing on compound movements). Still, if you do have some decent adjustable dumbbells such as PowerBlocks or Bowflex or if you're lucky enough to have a full dumbbell rack, then you can certainly get in an effective leg workout with this programme, even if it may not be the most enjoyable or efficient option.

Secondly, although it is not necessarily a criticism, you will find that to get results with Body Beast you will need to purchase some equipment sooner or later. Bands and resistance balls will not cut it if you plan on adding some muscle mass. I ended up purchasing some adjustable dumbbells with 2 expansion packs (approx £400 in total), a decent bench (£100), and a pull up bar (£20). This makes Body Beast perhaps the most expensive programmes to follow from the Beachbody line-up. Still, in the long term it's far cheaper than a gym membership and well worth it in my view.

## What equipment do I need?
Theoretically you only need some bands and a resistance ball to start out with. Let's get real though. If you plan to put on any muscle mass at all you will almost immediately need some dumbbells (light, medium and heavy), a bench and a pull-up bar. An EZ bar and weigh plates are optional, but certainly not essential. You may want to wait until you're sure Body Beast is for you before purchasing those. You're going to get sweaty so don't forget your towel and water bottle.

## What's included?
The Body Beast fitness guide, 'the Book of Beast' is first class, with very useful tools for determining your calorie intake and training needs. The accompanying nutrition guide also includes some genuinely delicious recipes albeit with a lot of advertising of Beachbody products.

## About the trainer, Sagi Kalev
From Sagi Kalev's LinkedIn: 'Sagi Kalev is a renowned expert in body building and physique transformation and became the first celebrity trainer to introduce body building to the Beachbody catalogue with the creation of his outrageously successful Body Beast program, which soon after led to showcasing the results his customers achieved with the Beachbody Classic. His fitness success began with his personal transformation 27 years ago earning him the coveted "Mr. Israel" title twice. He has appeared on the cover of more than 50 international fitness magazines, including Muscle & Fitness 11 times. He holds a degree in physical education from the University of Central Florida, is a Master Professional Personal Trainer, IFBB Pro, member of the IFBB Propta Hall of Fame, Certified Nutrition Specialist, and Functional Diagnostic Nutritionist. In addition to his upcoming collaboration to create The Master's Hammer and Chisel, Sagi's Equipment Room workouts are the first routines incorporated into Beachbody On Demand specifically for people to incorporate into their gym membership without the need for a personal trainer.'

## Who is it for?
If you have a home gym and want a solid programme to follow, Body Beast is probably the best option out there for most people. Expect to return to it time and again after completing the 90 day programme. Expect to mix and match it with your own and other workout programmes out there as you become more advanced. Start out with dummbells and progress to a fully equipped gym. Need a new challenge? Do like I did once you finish Body Beast - buy yourself a squat rack and barbell and swap out the dumbbell benchpresses, squats etc. with the barbell alternatives, allowing you to lift super heavy. In short, you might start this programme as a beginner, but find yourself still using it (or something very close to it) as an advanced lifter in the years to come. Highly recommended.

## The verdict
I would suggest to consider this programme if the following applies to you:

* You want to prioritise increased muscle mass over cardiovascular endurance
* You are interested in bodybuilding but don't know where to start/ need a simple programme to follow.
* You have some basic equipment including dumbbells in various weights, a bench and a pull-up bar as a minimum.
